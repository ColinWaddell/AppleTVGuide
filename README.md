# Introduction

I plan on using this site to document all the steps it take to get me from a factory default Apple TV to something capable of running XBMC, a samba server, Usenet and bit-torrent clients which are operated via web interfaces, BBC iPlayer and a few other things. All this is going to run under the latest Apple TV firmware (3.0.2).

I realise that sites such as [http://wiki.awkwardtv.org](http://wiki.awkwardtv.org) are flush with information, but I want to have a guide which is perfect for myself for the next time I have to perform this. Hopefully if your reading this then it can be of some help to yourself also.

As with any guide of this nature Im saying right now that I am taking no responsibility for anyone who follows any of my instructions and breaks their Apple TV; that’s your fault, not mine. I’m lucky enough to have a lot of experience at this sort of thing, if you don’t know what your doing then please don’t try anything described here.

One last thing. I am hosting all the recommended downloads. This is due to a difficulty not long ago with sourcing the Samba packages after the files dropped offline. I feel like as long as I’ve got a working copy of all the recommended files here then this problem won’t arise again. If however you feel that I shouldn’t be hosting other peoples (or your own) content, please let me know asap and I’ll have it sorted in a jiffy.

# Do You Have A Composite TV?

The Apple TV outputs in component video and HDMI. If you have a tv which requires a composite source (i.e. the video input on your TV just comes via one cable) then your going to have to be patient with a black and white picture for a few more steps.

To get an image on your screen from your Apple TV you need to connect a cable from the green (luma) component output to your yellow composite input and select 480i as the resolution for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC](NTSC) or 576i for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL](PAL) (or else it will flicker).
